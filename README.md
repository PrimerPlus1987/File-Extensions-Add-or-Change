# File-Extensions-Add-or-Change

This is a program that I made to allow you to quickly change the extension of your files.

If you have a file with no extension it will allow you to give it an extension.

This program is good for multiple files at once.

If you have suggestions, comments, or advice please comment and let me know.

This is my first public app I made and I hope it is useful.
